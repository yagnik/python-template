# Python Template Project

Things I want:
- Ability to run my whole dev env inside container

- Full IDE features if possible


TODO:
- [x] basic layout
- [x] setup.py, license, readme
- [x] support for make file
- [x] pipenv support
- [x] support for docker enviroment
- [x] code format + linting
- [x] static type checking enforcement

- [x] mock test example
- [x] hypothesis support
- [ ] auto generated docs
- [x] metrics
- [x] config
