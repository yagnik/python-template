# Python Template Project

Things I want:
- Ability to run my whole dev env inside container
- Not use vscode (slower than sublime in opening files)
- Full IDE features if possible


TODO:
- [ ] basic layout
- [ ] setup.py, license, readme
- [x] support for make file
- [x] pipenv support
- [x] support for docker enviroment
- [ ] support for pycharm ( python language server with docker is too much pain )
- [x] code format + linting
- [x] static type checking enforcement
- [x] code coverage
- [x] unit test with pytest
- [x] doctest support ( not using flake8 plugin cause it includes test files no matter what I do)
- [x] mock test example
- [x] hypothesis support
- [ ] auto generated docs
- [ ] contract test example
- [ ] logging
- [ ] metrics/tracing
